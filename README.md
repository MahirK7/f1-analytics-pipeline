🏎️ F1 Data Engineering Pipeline

An end-to-end Formula 1 data engineering pipeline that ingests race telemetry from the FastF1 API
, cleans and structures it in MySQL, orchestrates workflows with Apache Airflow, and visualizes insights via Python plots, Grafana, and Power BI.

🚀 Features

ETL Pipeline – Extracts raw race/session data, transforms it (null handling, outlier removal, standardization), and loads into MySQL.

Workflow Orchestration – Airflow DAGs automate ingestion, retries, and scheduling.

Database Design – Normalized schema with sessions, drivers, and laps tables.

Containerized Deployment – Docker Compose runs Airflow, MySQL, and Grafana together.

Analytics & Visualization – Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for tyre degradation and stint analysis, plus dashboards in Grafana/Power BI.

CI/CD Practices – Version control with Git + Docker for reproducibility and scalable deployment.

⚡ Getting Started

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-analytics-pipeline.git
cd f1-analytics-pipeline


Start Docker services

docker-compose up -d


Access services

Airflow UI → http://localhost:8080

Grafana → http://localhost:3000

MySQL → localhost:3306

Trigger the DAG

In Airflow, trigger ingest_fastf1_dag to fetch and store race data.
